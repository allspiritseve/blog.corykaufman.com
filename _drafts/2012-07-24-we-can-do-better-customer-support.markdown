# We can do better customer support

I recently upgraded my chat client (Adium) on my laptop. The application
was flat out broken, with a black screen instead of a contact list.

It was late, but I googled a bit and couldn't find a solution (granted, the update's only
been out 2 days) so I ended up tweeting the Adium team:

> &#64;adium latest update was totally broken (contact list was a black screen). Any way to downgrade?

Their response:

## I think we can provide better customer support than this.

Let me preface this by saying: I'm not complaining about Adium's
specific response. They actually got back to me, and in a reasonable amount of
time. However, I think this type of response is typical for a lot of
companies these days. 

I'd love to see us take our customer support to the next level, especially
given we have tools like Twitter at our fingertips.

## Your users don't care about making your application better, they just want their copy to work.

I'm fairly technical, and could probably write a pretty detailed bug
   report that would be useful to Adium in solving the problem. But most
of the time, I don't want to. I just want my chat client to work. I can only imagine
less technical people want to write bug reports even less than I do.

## Bug reporting is boring. Remove as many barriers as possible.

Telling anyone that submits a bug report that another bug report exists for the same problem discourages that person from ever
providing a bug report again. Bug reporting is boring, and generally has
little payoff. If someone does it, it's probably because they're a good
person and want to help out. Don't give them more barriers (like
checking *all* of the existing bug reports for a similar problem) before
posting. 

## Don't be lazy; take the time to give your customers *helpful* info.

Posting a link to an existing bug report with no other information is lazy. It's the equivalent
of a forum post saying someone's already posted on this topic before.
Who cares? If you have to organize and respond to bug reports, *you* might care, but I sure don't. At the very least, create a bug report for my issue and mark it as a duplicate of the old report. Even better, give me a short synopsis of where the other
bug report stands. Is it solved? At the bottom of the list? Do I need to do anything to fix my own
installation? Could I provide you with more information, or maybe a +1
to let you know it's important? Yes, I realize
customer support is a tough job and this is a lot more work. But the goal is to make your customers
happy, not to make your support process easier for you. If you treat my bug
report with respect, that makes me want to help you and your team and
provides incentive to do more work. Make it easy for your customers to
get in the door, and they'll probably be happy to help you improve your
app.

## Allow anonymous bug reports

Nobody wants to sign up for an account just to post a bug report. I
   should be able to add a comment to an existing bug report, and create
a new one, anonymously. If I want a followup, I'll gladly give you my
email address or Twitter username.

## Use Twitter as an entry form into your bug tracker

Twitter should be your support's best friend. The barrier to
contacting you is so low that it's the easiest way to get in touch.
If I tweet a problem with your service, create a bug report from my
tweet and let me know someone is looking into it. If you're feeling
really ambitious, mention me when there are updates.

I'd love to hear other ideas on this.
