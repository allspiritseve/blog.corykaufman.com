# Social graphs

Lately I've been reading about building social communities, probably
because I'm interested in the current movement to replace Twitter with
something more open.

One article I read mentioned how some communities leveraged Facebook's
existing social graph early on to get started. I can see the appeal; a
few clicks of the button, and all your existing connections are
transferred to the new site.

That means with every new site we sign up for, our social graph will get
larger and larger.

That's good, right? After all, aren't our social relationships really

Facebook says yes (though I wouldn't be surprised if they started adding
something similar to Google+'s Circles). Google says yes. LinkedIn says
yes.

However, I think that theory is flawed. Whether or not we can distill
our social relationships into one big graph doesn't matter, because it's
not static: just because I was Facebook friends with someone once doesn't mean I
want to stay connected with them forever.

If I log into my Facebook account right now, there are ex girlfriends,
high school aquantances, college friends I don't talk to anymore. Yet,
many of these people want to keep up with my updates. I have no problem
with that; most of what I write online is meant for anyone to read who
is interested. That's the beauty of the web.

However, I think there is real value in being able to subscribe and unsubscribe
to whoever I want without worrying about them knowing I've
unsubscribed. I think Twitter should work more like RSS feeds, where
people can count the number of subscribers, but don't know *who* they
are.
