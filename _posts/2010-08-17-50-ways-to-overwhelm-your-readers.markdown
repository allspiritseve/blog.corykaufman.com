# 50 ways to overwhelm your readers

I see these types of posts everywhere these days. Bloggers collect
tutorials, plugins, tricks, tips, etc. and package them together into
the "50 best (things) every (type of person) should know".

For a long time, I used to think that these types of posts were
worthwhile. I used to put them on my "to read" list, thinking that
someday I'd have the energy to check out all 50 on the list. I never did
though, and there they sat, day after day. It's no wonder I avoid
reading my backlog of bookmarks.

Lately, I avoid these types of articles like the plague. (Though they
still turn up in my bookmarks occasionally. I promptly delete them when
my sanity has returned.) I personally believe it is a sign of a lazy
blogger to throw together all of this content and expect readers to sort
through it. That means they don't want to take the time to pull out the
truly valuable from the cruft.

Bloggers: unless I can appreciate each item on your list in less than 10
seconds (think "50 stunning photographs" or "50 best desktop
backgrounds") don't give me any more than 3 things to review in any one
post. (Hell, if you're really daring, pick *one*!) Highlight the
best of the best, and tell me why I should care.

Don't make me do your job for you.
