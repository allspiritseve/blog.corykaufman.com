# Slow carb recipe: tuna, broccoli and pinto beans

A few friends have asked me what you're allowed to eat on the slow carb diet.
I've decided to write down a few of my go-to recipes so people can see what
I eat on a regular basis.

## Tuna, Broccoli &amp; Pinto Beans

I couldn't come up with a better name for this, so for now I'm just calling it
by the ingredients.

1 can tuna (I've been buying the tuna in water).
1-2 cups (ish) broccoli florets
1/2 - 1 cup (ish) pinto beans
Salt, pepper, lemon juice to taste.

Directions: (Pay attention, this is tricky) place beans, florets, and tuna in
a bowl. Sprinkle lemon juice, salt and pepper on the tuna to taste. I usually
leave the broccoli frozen and then by lunchtime a minute or two in the
microwave warms everything up evenly. You could also steam the broccoli if you
wanted it to be more crisp.

Notes: I buy frozen broccoli florets. They're a bit more expensive than
broccoli cuts, but I tend to not like the broccoli stems when frozen. They just
don't taste very good. You could do fresh broccoli, though I'd recommend
blanching it first.
