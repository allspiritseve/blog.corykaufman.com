# On Creativity

When I was little, I used to create things constantly. Starting from 8th
grade, I wrote chapters of a fantasy novel with the intention of
publishing it some day. I liked to draw, as well. 

Somewhere along the way, I stopped drawing and writing. I didn't draw
much starting in High School-- I'd doodle in class, but never worked on
much that I wanted to keep. I wrote a lot during High School, especially
during my Creative Writing class, but then somewhere around my senior
year I just... stopped.

I think those people who talk about creativity as a muscle are on the
right track. If you don't use it, you get rusty, out of shape mentally.
I don't think I actually stopped being creative, but all that energy got
funneled into other pursuits, like writing mediocre papers for classes I was
only mildly interested in.

What is really disheartening is when I try and go back and get
into writing or drawing, I have these aweful critical voices in my head
telling me how everything I'm doing sucks. 

You know what? I want to do it anyway. The secret about perfectionism is
that you don't have to avoid it altogether, just *delay* it until it's
time to edit. Write a crappy first draft, and then use that perfectionism to refine. 

I find the same critical voices spilling over into my digital creative
work. I have this web application I want to write, and I have such a
hard time getting started. I keep telling myself how perfect it needs to
be, but in reality I just haven't gotten the courage to write that first draft
yet. 

I feel it coming soon, though. Nearly every day I sit down with some
intention of working on that draft. The ideas are flowing, I just need
to put pen to paper.
