# Why you should air dry your clothes

Back when I was looking for some easy ways to cut down our electricity
bill for our apartment in Ann Arbor,  I decided to try hanging up our
clothes instead of drying them in the dryer (there's a reason why you
can't buy an energy-star certified dryer). It's not a huge money saver
(I think I read somewhere it's about $.50/load).

I guess I'm not exactly a stranger to hanging up clothes-- my mom has
done it for years, and that's how my madre dried my clothes when I lived
in Spain. I actually really liked the feel of my clothes after they'd air dried in
the hot Spanish sun&em; it reminded me of freshly starched linens at the
restaurant where I worked as a kid.

My biggest concern with hanging up clothes was that it seemed like a lot of extra
work in an already annoying process. I guess I just haven't really
enjoying doing laundry in the past.

I ended up buying a fancy clothes hanger on Amazon that has a lot of
horizontal space (those hangers that look like stacked X shapes aren't
actually very good for air drying, because you're laying wet clothes on
top of other wet clothes, so they don't air out as well. The more
surface area open to the air, the better.

The funny thing was, once I started hanging up my clothes, I found I
acutally *enjoyed* doing laundry. It was relaxing in a way; my old
laundry habits essentially consisted in trying to get 5 or 6 loads of
clothes through as fast as possible, since we were usually out of clean clothes
and I wanted to delay the next big laundry job as long as possible.

When you air dry, you don't really have room for more than one load per
day. Clothes (at least in my basement) take almost a full day to dry, so
that means I can do a max of one load per day. What used to be a process
of "get this over with as fast as possible" turned into a short, daily
process that didn't really matter how long it took, because I could only
do one load.

It also, in a way, saves me an extra step: sorting clothes. Since
everything's laid out on the hangar, I can easy just grab my own
laundry, or my wife's, and throw it into a separate hamper to take
upstairs. No more dumping a big hamper on the ground and sorting through
it! 

Some tips:

You'll have to find a good place in your house for air drying. In the
winter, my basement was perfect: not too cold, steps from the washer,
and, most importantly: right next to our gas heater which gives off
enough heat to dry even a 100% cotton sweatshirt or jeans in 24 hours. I
haven't done this in the summer yet, but I suspect it might be better to
lug the wet clothes upstairs and hang them up in our bedroom in front of
the window. The basement will probably be too damp and cool, and since
we're not running the heater, I won't have any source of heat for the
hard-to-dry stuff.

Speaking of hard to dry stuff, hang those closest to your heat source
(ideally, the sun) and the easy-to-try stuff that wicks really well,
hang farthest away (sports clothes, camping clothes, etc. are usually
really good at wicking moisture, so they dry fast).

Sheets can be awkward to hang up (they don't fit on my regular hanger so
I had to string up a line in the rafters of the basement) and take
longer to dry. If you can't get those out in the hot sun, you might want
to throw those in your dryer. Sometimes frugality isn't as important as
having fresh, dry sheets!
