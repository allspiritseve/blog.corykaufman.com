# The cloud isn't always better

It's funny how differently I think about the native vs. web debate now that I'm in an area with pretty unreliable internet. I used to listen to Pandora and (occasionally) Spotify, but these days I'm mostly just listening to my offline music collection.

I won't get into the licensing restrictions outside the US (my VPN solves that problem) but basically, any application that requires the internet to work is probably not going to be very useful for me right now.
