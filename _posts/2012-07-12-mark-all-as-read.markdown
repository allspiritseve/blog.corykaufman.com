# Mark all as read

I like subscribing to blog posts through Google Reader. It's so much fun
to have awesome articles to read in my reading list every day. 

However, it can really easily get overloaded. One of the tricks I have
to handle that is that whenever I subscribe to a new blog, I immediately
mark all their posts as read.

Honestly, if I'm that interested in their stuff, I'll go back and read
the old posts. With 20+ posts from a single blog in my reading list,
it's easy to go numb and start skipping over posts. As soon as I do
that, though, I know I'm not really getting much use out of the list.

By marking everything as read, I get to start fresh every day.
