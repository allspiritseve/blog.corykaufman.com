# When will we see a laptop made specifically for linux?

A few days ago I thought my MacBook pro was damaged via being in my backpack
during torrential Costa Rican rain. Since I was probably going to have to buy
a new computer, I figured I'd research a new PC to run Linux. Windows PCs are
drastically cheaper than Apple for the same internals, so I figured I'd save
a bit of money.

My last few laptops had been Dells, but despite the decent warranties I wanted
a change. I've heard Lenovo makes really solid laptops, but I can't stand that
weird button in the middle of the keyboard, and I don't understand the point of
the three buttons above the trackpad. Asus has one of the lowest failure rates
among hardware makers, including Apple, so I decided to check them out.

Wow, I was not prepared for that site. I know I want a 15" laptop, and there's
no way to drill down by size. First you have to pick the series, and then see
what sizes are offered in that series. I left with a bad taste in my mouth.

Wouldn't it be awesome if a hardware maker decided to make a laptop
specifically for Linux? Sure, Dell offered laptops with Ubuntu preinstalled,
but they were buried in the site and not well supported. And I don't recall the
windows key being replaced with a penguin, either.

What I would love to see is a hardare maker step up and offer a solid choice to
Linux enthusiasts. Pick the internals with the best support (ideally with open
source drivers, but I realize that's not always feasible) and give users
3 simple choices: 13", 15", 17".

On the other side of this, I'd love to see linux users embrace a single
hardware maker and recommend it to all their friends. I tried googling for
recommended laptops to install Linux on... most posts devolved into
troubleshooting someone's hardware issues, and very few posters made any
attempt to summarize the state of linux hardware. 

Linux is already overwhelming as it is... simply picking a distro is an
exercise in the paradox of choices. Having to pick from the myriad of hardware
makers is exhausting.

I realize my proposal probably has a slim chance of ever seeing the light...
but it sure would be nice.

Oh, and for those that are wondering: the MacBook pro is fine. I let it sit for
a few days and the water inside the LCD screen evaporated.

Edit: Found [This laptop](http://zareason.com/shop/UltraLap-430.html) the other
day... it's not as slick as a Macbook Pro, obviously, but other than that
I think it looks like a great linux laptop. If you're in the market, this is
the one I'd recommend buying!
