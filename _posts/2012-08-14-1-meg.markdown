title: 1meg internet is all we need
---

# {{ page.title }}

There's been a lot of buzz lately about Google Fiber in Kansas City, and how
that's how internet should be.

Honestly, I haven't cared about how fast my internet was since I convinced my
parents to switch from dialup to cable. 

The far, far more important thing has always been reliability. I just got back
from a 3 month trip in Costa Rica. The internet there is anything but reliable.
But at it's best, sitting in a reclining chair in our apartment in Santo
Domingo, I got a 1meg connection. 

And you know what? 1meg is good enough for just about anything I want to do.
I could stream HBO Go (using a US VPN of course, since they don't allow
international traffic), I could download linux ISOs, I could listen to
streaming music. 

I don't think a 1,000meg connection is going to be the standard any time soon.
I would much prefer ISPs to focus on providing a reliable, everywhere 1meg
connection that spans the country.

In Costa Rica, that internet cost me $18/month. Why not the same here?
$20/month seems perfect for basic, reliable internet. No data caps, no
throttling (below the 1meg limit of course). Simple.
