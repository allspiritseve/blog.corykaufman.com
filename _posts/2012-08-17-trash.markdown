title: There's trash everywhere
---

# {{ page.title }}

I started working in the Tech Brewery in Ann Arbor a little over a year ago. My
house is less than ten minutes away, so I walk pretty much every day.

The path to work goes down some steps in the woods, crosses a busy street, goes
through a park, and then a quiet residential neighborhood. It's an extremely
relaxing way to start my day. 

I recently got back from a three month stay in Costa Rica. Costa Rica has
a trash problem-- they aren't a big country, so there's not much room for huge
landfills and such like we have in the U.S. 

As a result, there's trash everywhere-- on the street, in the gutters, the
sidewalks, etc. I often felt like picking it up-- but as there are rarely
public trash cans, I just didn't have a place to put it.

For some reason, now that I'm back home, I still feel compelled to pick up
trash. I've been grabbing a bag each morning on my walk to work.

Every single day, that trash bag has been full to bursting before I've even
reached the Tech Brewery. *It is shocking how much trash I've walked by, for an
entire year, without bothering to pick it up.*

Makes me wonder, as a developer, how much bad code I see every day and do
nothing about. I wonder how much better at my job I would be if I just
refactored a small grocery bag's worth each day.
