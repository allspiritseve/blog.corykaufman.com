# {{ page.title }}

I've discussed this idea with a few friends, and everyone seems to like it. I'm
certainly not the first to think of it, but I want to spell out my ideas for
future reference.

Recipes, like open source projects, are always changing. For those of us who
like to tinker with recipes, there's not a great place to keep track of what
we've tried and what we haven't. 

The best solution right now is paper recipes. These have some advantages: some
of my family's more treasured recipes are written in the handwriting of our
loved ones who first shared the recipe with us. 

Paper recipes are easily available, you can keep them in your kitchen and pull
them out when you want to cook.

On the other hand: recipes get dirty. The worst culrit seems to be oil, as the
paper just soaks it up and it's never the same again.

We need some way to record our recipes online, in a way that is compatible with
paper recipes but with some digital benefits.

I'd love a system where I could add a family recipe, "fork" it, and make my
changes while still referencing the original recipe. I'd like to write notes
for each version to talk about what I tried, whether it worked or didn't, etc.
