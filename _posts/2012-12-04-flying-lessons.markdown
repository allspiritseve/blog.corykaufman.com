# {{ page.title }}

Someone recently told me about an episode of The Cosby Show in which one of the characters tries to hire a helicopter to fly to his prom by requesting flying lessons.

I thought that was the perfect metaphor for a few clients I've encountered in the past. For various reasons, they come to me asking for flying lessons, but what they really want is transportation. 

I think this can happen for a variety of reasons. If money is really tight, and flying lessons are all they can afford, they might grudgingly accept that as a short term solution to their problem. Others might think themselves entrepreneurial, and think they know the secret words that can get them transportation at flying lessons rates.

Regardless of their motivations, these types of projects have never worked out. Inevitably, the client discovers that what they're getting are just flying lessons, and they can't *really* tell the pilot to just drop them off at their prom. All they can really do is fly around in circles, and land.

The tricky part, once you know these types of projects are dangerous, is discovering as early as possible when someone is asking for transportation. For the budget client, just asking them might be enough. For the crafty ones, they might get suspicious and hide their true intentions. After all, if you discover they want transportation, the gig's up-- and they know they have to pay for it.
