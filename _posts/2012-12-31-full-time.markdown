title: I don't do anything full time
---

I think the notion of 'full time' is interesting.

I don't do anything full time.

Full time is like rowing. What I do is more like building a bunch of little sailboats, and shoving them out in the hope that the wind catches one or two.

It doesn't take much, a few sticks, a rubber band, and a sail.

And a little something extra.
