I've had a few experiences with clients this past year that have gotten me thinking more about client expectations.
The projects start out innocently enough, but eventually it becomes clear that the client was envisioning an entirely
different outcome.

That situation is actually pretty normal for client work. Most clients don't have a clear picture of what they want,
and it takes some practice to help them define their requirements. 

The problem is when the client gets upset because the deliverable they see isn't what they wanted.

I think this can happen for a variety of reasons. They might have a tight budget, and can't afford what they really
want. They might not understand the difficulty of the problem they need solved, and assume it can be done quickly and
easily if they just get us to look at it. Or, they might think they know the secret words that can buy them a
finished product at a bargain price.

Whatever their motivations, these types of deals are dangerous. Almost inevitably, the client discovers that they're
getting what they asked for, and not what they really wanted.

The tricky part is spotting mismatched client expectations as early as possible. To start, I would avoid any
arrangements that involve paid coding lessons. That's what [Coffee House Coders](http://a2.coffeehousecoders.com) is
for.

Someone recently told me about an episode of The Cosby Show in which Theo and his friends try to
arrange a helicopter to fly them to their prom by requesting flying lessons. I thought this was the
perfect metaphor for these projects. Inevitably, the client discovers that what they're getting are
just flying lessons, and all they can really do is fly around in circles. They can't get anywhere.
