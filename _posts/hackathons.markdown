title: Hackathons are the opposite of what we need
---

It seems like hackathons are all the rage these days. Get a bunch of talented people in a room for 24-72 hours, award a prize for the best whatever, and let them at it.

What are the problems with this scenario?

Well, to start with, it promotes the stereotype of cowboy hackers that work late into then night, chugging can after can of Mountain Dew, and churning out line after line of flawless code.

Most of the developers I know like beer, not Mountain Dew. If you weren't aware, beer is a depressant and probably doesn't mix well with getting a lot of code written in a small amount of time. They like getting to bed on time. Hell, they might even have a family. 

Any time I hear of a hackathon-type meetup that's more than four hours or so, I get a bad taste in my mouth. I just don't really see the appeal of being shut in a room with pizza and caffeine and a computer for X number of hours. 

Finally, what message do hackathons send to our clients, customers, and employers? If they stuff us full of pizza and pop, we just magically churn out something useful?

Coding takes time, it takes revision, it takes deep thought. Taking breaks, going for walks, doing something else for a while, all these things are not just beneficial to our code but to our health and our sanity. We need to stop the propogation of the idea that we are magical in some way, that we are "Ninjas" or "Cowboys" or "Rockstars". Instead, we should be promoting the idea that we are craftsman, and what we do is an art, not magic. What other artesanal craft do you know of where speed is valued over quality? None, that's what. 

If we don't have hackathons, how do we share our awesome projects with other people? I would suggest getting some friends together once a month to show something off. A month is a good amount of time where you can produce something meaningful, but not so much time that you can overengineer. 

This is what my friend Alan and I are doing in Ann Arbor with Show & Tell. We meet once a month, write a quick blog post about our latest project, and show it off to our friends. It's great motivation, and promotes everything we value as software artisans.

I'd love to hear about similar meetups in other towns. If you're running something similar or thinking about starting a meetup, get in touch!
